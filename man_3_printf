NAME
       _printf - Custom printf Implementation

SYNOPSIS
       #include "main.h"

       int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The _printf() function is a custom implementation of the printf function,
       used to print formatted output to the standard output stream.

       - _printf(format, ...): This function takes a format string and a variable
         number of arguments, formats them according to the format string, and
         writes the resulting string to the standard output. It returns the number
         of characters written, or -1 if an error occurs.

       The format string may contain ordinary characters (which are copied directly
       to the output) and conversion specifications, which start with the % character
       and may be followed by optional flags, field width, precision, and conversion
       specifier characters.

       The following conversion specifiers are supported:

       - %c: Print a single character.
       - %s: Print a string of characters.
       - %d, %i: Print a signed integer.
       - %%: Print a literal % character.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, _printf() returns the number of characters
       printed, excluding the null terminator. If an error occurs, -1 is returned.

       Possible error conditions include invalid format strings, memory allocation
       failures, or other internal errors.

EXAMPLES
       The following example demonstrates basic usage of the _printf() function:

           #include "main.h"
           #include <stdio.h>

           int main() {
               int len = _printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
               printf("Number of characters printed: %d\n", len);
               return 0;
           }

       Output:
           Hello, world!
           Number of characters printed: 13
